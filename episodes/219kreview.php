<h1>&gt; &gt; review- 219- the rager</h1>

<p>&quot;It's like finding a unicorn, a really hot unicorn.&quot;</p>

<p>I still find it surprising that such a huge party could have come from five kids throwing a surprise birthday party for someone no one really knows. In my personal experience, you have to pass out those cheesy little flyers during history to pull that off. But then again, we are in The O.C.</p>

<p>That aside, the Rager was as episode that satisfied my most primal O.C. urges. We got to see the gang get seriously screwed over at a party that can only be pulled off in Orange County; a party that included drugs, alcohol, and punching people. Josh Schwartz must be begining to realize that it is mostly this material that drew people to watch the show in the first place. These are hot kids with hot parents that live in one of the most hyped up places in California. What we like in the show is seeing kids that we can realate to in situations that we can only dream about. This episode reminded me of the first episode all over again. Unfortunately, that's part of the reason why I didn't enjoy it as much.</p>

<p>It seems that the writers have forgoten who these characters are in the past season. Summer used to be funny and confident, now all we see from her is overwhelming jealousy and inability to cope with the fact that Seth actually does other things besides her. I used to find their bickering cute, when Summer made fun of Seth's &quot;whiny music&quot; and lack of knowledge about tools (we're talking the hardware kind here). In &quot;The Escape&quot; the cute Sethummer fights felt fresh. Now they just feel used and unbelievable.</p>

<p>Also unbelievable was the Zach sabatoge scene. Why Seth felt that Zach couldn't have an innocent crush on Reed is beyond me. Most guys I know would be fighting over who would get to go for it, not thinking about the problems that come from having a relationship with your boss. I think there was supposed to be some sort of love triangle between the three of them. I didn't really get it.</p>

<p>Too much brotherly love is happening on The O.C. lately. The plot goes a bit like this: Trey lets Ryan down. Ryan gets pissed off and refuses to forgive Trey. Marissa steps in. Ryan forgives Trey. They hug. As I saw the scene where Ryan becomes best friends with his brother again at the party, I had the strangest sense of deja vu, as if I had seen this before. And then I realized that I had seen it before: when Trey stole the watch, when Trey stole the egg, when Trey lied about the apartment. And I'm pretty sure it will happen again when Trey tells his story about what happened with the drugs. Exciting.</p>

<p>However, for as much as I've picked apart this episode, I have to say that I did like the Julie as a reformed porn star story arc. When I saw the preview with Julie about the kill Lance, I was not looking forward to it, but when I actually say the scene I was happily surprised. I liked Julie's plan to make Lance feel like his life had been taken away, the scene was emotional and striking. I actually liked the scene with them in the bar, drunken Julie is definitely a favorite of mine. And I'm actually excited about what may happen with Caleb during the end of the season.</p>

<p>Yes, the O.C. has been getting much better since &quot;The Rainy Day Women&quot; aired. The annoying new characters were able to disappear to some far less glamorous part of the country, and hopefully they won't be back. Zach, the only new character that I actually liked, has been able to remain in the show without taking the attention off the main characters. There haven't been repetitive scenes in the Bait Shop, Marissa hasn't been constantely inebriated, and some of the characters were actually allowed to remain single. But there are still some things that aren't working well for the O.C.</p>

<p>There is still too much of an emphasis on the couples. And while I think that relationships are great, I would urge the writers to remember that sometimes people are *gasp* single. Do you remember the last time Summer didn't have a boyfriend? Somewhere around the very beginning of the first season. Think about how many relationships Marissa has gone through this season (and I'm thinking that an unfortunate Trey/ Marissa/ Ryan triangle is in the brewing). Even the married characters (Caleb excluded) have been presented with love intrests.</p>

<p>I wish that the writers, Josh included, could just forget the fact that their show isn't doing as well as the want it to. They can forget trying to be edgy with stories about rock bands (not that I don't love the bands, but they aren't the focus), stories about lesbians, and stories about drugged up tattooed teenagers. They can even forget what they did during the first season. What they need to do to save the show is start on a blank slate.</p>

<p>This episode didn't make me cry tears of anguish, but there were also no tears of joy. I give it 3 out of 5 surfboards.</p>
