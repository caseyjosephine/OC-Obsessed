Alright guys, so obviously we all think that Travis is awesome, and we don't want the site to go awhere. And, of course, we wouldn't mind having the high quality 350mb downloads, would we? So here's how this is going to work. I'm uploading all of my 350mb files to http://www.yousendit.com. This will allow the episode to be downloaded 7 times. After you download an episode from here, please use yousendit to upload the episode again, then post the link here. I don't have all the episodes, so if anyone can help out that will be awesome.

The theory here is that we will be able to get the episodes we want without using so much of the site's bandwidth, so that it doesn't cost Travis so much. We'll all have to put in a bit of work, but it should be worth it. 

A final note, please start with the first link on the list, and copy-paste it into a new browser page so that ocfansforum doesn't show up on the referer page a billion times. Oh yeah, and I'm recommending that y'all have a high speed connection to participate in the exchange.
