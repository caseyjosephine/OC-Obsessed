<p>&quot;Seth Cohen Is A Tool&quot;</p>

<p>The OC is skitzophrenic. Sometimes, it's just absolutely terrible. Other times, it redeems itself. This was one of the latter, the episode was actually pretty good.</p>

<p>I liked the idea that Summer came up with. It reminded me of an episode of friends, season 7 TOW The Nap Partners. Monica doesn't want to decide who is going to be her maid of honor, so she let's Phoebe and Rachel make the decision for her. And they both know exactly what the right decision should be, it just takes them a little while to get there. This was the same idea, Zach was himself again (see, it's okay to like a water-polo player!), and they tried to figure things out. I think this made for a great resolution.</p>

<p>The Ryan/Marissa storyline was great. I like that the thing with Trey is a triangle without actually being a triangle, the points are there but Ryan pretty much draws in his own lines. Ryan was great, Marissa wasn't melodramatic, and Trey pulled the in-character &quot;You should trust me&quot; thing. I still don't like Trey, but he wasn't terrible tonight. I liked how they brought Theresa back tonight without making it bad. She offered good advice, and we know what's going on with the baby thing. It's in the house, she's lost the baby weight (how??), and she doesn't want Ryan to know. And since she was shown tonight, it was a clue that he'll definitely find out.</p>

<p>The adults were fabulous. Kirsten was believable as an alcoholic. She always has been. And she needs to get sent to that center, because she's pretty screwed up right now. The Julie/ Caleb scene was great, I loved how Julie pulled the margarita away (don't poison your husbands, people!). And I'm kind of sad Caleb is gone, but I knew it was coming. Now Julie is rich (how it should be) and the Cohens have a bit more to deal with.</p>

<p>But the best part of the episode. The prom king and queen part. Seeing Summer up there by herself was devestating. It felt terrible to here her say that &quot;no one was coming.&quot; And I loved the groans from the audience when Seth got up there, and the kid that kept yelling &quot;Seth Cohen is a tool!&quot; That jerk's just jealous, I'm sure...</p>

<p>I didn't like the George Lucas scene. I LOVE George Lucas, he rocks my socks. But that wasn't written well. I also didn't like Marissa's clothes. But I liked the episode more than most of the ones I've been seeing lately. I'm glad the writers are getting some brains.</p>

<p>I liked the episode, very well done. 5 out of 5 surfboards!</p>
