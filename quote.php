<h1>&gt; &gt; quotes</h1>

<p>Here are some memorable quotes from each episode of The O.C.</p>

<p><strong>Episode 23- The O.Sea</strong></p>

<p><strong>Ryan:</strong> What time is it?
<br /><strong>Seth:</strong> It's 5:30... ish.
<br /><strong>Ryan:</strong> You're showing up earlier and earlier.
<br /><strong>Seth:</strong> Yeah, well, we had a lot of ground to cover, so I figured, since we're both up, we may as well get a jump on it.</p>

<p><strong>Julie:</strong> Sandy, I did not come here to talk about myself. But as long as we're on the subject, I could kind of use your advice.
<br /><strong>Sandy:</strong> Hey, if this involves you being naked, please: you gotta warn me.</p>

<p><strong>Seth:</strong> I think one day, pretty soon, we're all gonna have a good laugh about this. Ha ha ha. I know that day feels far off, but comedy is just tragedy plus time.</p>

<p><strong>Reed:</strong> Look, I hate to give you good news, but unfortunately, I have some. George Lucas is interested in Atomic County. And he might want to make it into his next movie.
<br /><strong>Seth:</strong> Oh my god! We're like this decade's Matt and Ben.</p>

<p><strong>Kirsten:</strong> I may like my Chardonnay, but I am not going to die alone, and that's more than I can say for you!</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> Sick? Too sick to take you to the prom? He better be real sick- like dead- or I'm going to strangle him with his own wifebeater.</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> My dream involved a date. A hot guy in a tux with a carnation pinned to his lapel. Instead I'm drawing straws between Nerd Boy and Ass Clown.</p>
