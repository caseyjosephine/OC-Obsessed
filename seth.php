<p><strong>Character Name</strong>- Seth Cohen<br /><br />
<strong>Think of Him As</strong>- A geeky outsider, but by choice<br /><br />
<strong>Season One Recap</strong>- Seth finds his one real friend when Ryan joins his family. With new found confidence he pursues two girls: Summer and Anna. After a short fling with Anna, he realizes that Summer  is definitely the one for him. However, things take a bad turn when Ryan leaves to go back to Chino with Theresa. Now that he doesn't have a friend in Newport, he gets on his sailboat and leaves the O.C. (and Summer) behind.
<br /><br />
<strong>You can probably find him</strong>- Playing video games, sailing, or reading comic books.<br /><br /> 
<strong>Great Seth Quote</strong>- (after sex with Summer) &quot;I was like a fish... flopping around on dryland, Ryan... I was Nemo and i just wanted to go home.&quot;
