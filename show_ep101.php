<h1>&gt; &gt; the pilot</h1>

<p>For public defender Sandy Cohen, Ryan Atwood is a sad but typical case. His older brother, Trey, convinced him to help steal a car, and the two were caught. Trey had drugs and a weapon on him, and will be locked up for awhile, however Sandy is sure that he can clear Ryan. After spending some time with Ryan and looking at his test scores, he realizes that there's something special about this kid from the wrong side of the tracks.</p>

<p>After getting home, Ryan's alcoholic mother remarks that Ryan is a burden on her family. In a drunken rage, she forces him to get out of the house. He leaves on his bike and calls his friends from a payphone, searching for a place to stay. When no one picks up, he calls Sandy Cohen on a whim. Sandy comes to pick Ryan up, taking him back to his lavish mansion in Newport Beach.</p>

<p>Sandy's wife, Kirsten, is not happy about the fact that Ryan is staying in her house for the weekend: what if he corrupts their teenage son, Seth? While the two argue, Ryan goes to the end of the driveway to smoke a cigarette. There he meets Marissa, the beautiful girl next door, who leaves with her boyfriend after assuming that Ryan is actually the Cohen's cousin from Boston. She invites Ryan to her charity fashion show the next day.</p>

<p>In the morning, Ryan encounters Seth, who entertains Ryan with video games and a sailing trip. On his boat, he explains to Ryan that he is in love with a girl named Summer. Unfortuantely, he has never talked to her before. Next door, Marissa opens the door to find some official looking men outside, asking for her dad. She explains that he isn't home, although a cut to her dad in his office shows that he just doesn't want to deal with them right now. Marissa hopes that everything is okay.</p>

<p>At the fashion show, it becomes apparent that Seth isn't part of the cool crowd: he and Ryan end up sitting at a table with 12 year olds. Marissa and Summer sneak alcohol during the show, and later invite Ryan and Seth to a party at Holly's beach house. They walk in to find kids doing drugs and having threesomes in the bathroom. Ryan notices Marissa's boyfriend, Luke, with another girl on the beach. At that point, a drunken Summer gets all over Ryan in an attempt to win him over. Seth sees this and spills to everyone that Ryan is from Chino. When Seth gets back to the beach, Luke and his water polo friends start beating him up. Ryan throws a few punches and helps Seth out, then goes back to the Cohen's.When he gets there, he sees Summer and Holly leaving a passed out Marissa on her driveway. He goes and brings her into the poolhouse, leaving her on his bed while he sleeps on the floor.</p>

<p>In the morning, Marissa is gone and Kirsten is not happy that her son is beat up and probably still a bit drunk. She wants Ryan out of her house. After he makes breakfast for the Cohens, Sandy drives him back to Chino. When he gets to his house, he finds that no one is there. Sandy tells Ryan to come with him, and the screen fades to black.</p>
