<h1>&gt; &gt; the dearly beloved</h1>

<p>Sandy decides that it's time for Kirsten to go into rehab because of her alcohol addiction, and calls the clinic to step up an intervention. Meanwhile, many of the people who left Orange County are returning for Caleb's funeral, including Jimmy and Hailey. While those who were close to Caleb mourn, Jess tells Trey that she can make some easy money as long as Trey can point a gun &quot;like he means it.&quot; Kirsten turns to vodka to deal with her dad's death at the reception, where she refuses to let Summer or Julie help her. Desperate to get out of the house, the kids decide to go to the Bait Shop. However, things don't go well at the Bait Shop- Jess's customers refuse to pay her, and the gang gets caught in the crossfire. Ryan decides that he can't have Trey in Newport, and asks him to leave. 

<p>At the Nichol residence, sparks are flying between the Cooper's. Things aren't going so well at the Cohen's- Seth does not want to admit that his mom has a problem with alcohol. Sandy reminds him that this has been going on for awhile, and assures Seth that rehab is what Kirsten needs. Meanwhile, Marissa finally tells Summer what happened between her and Trey. </p>

<p>During the intervention, Sandy, Hailey, Ryan and Seth convince Kirsten that her drinking has become a problem. They help her pack up and get to rehab. Afterwards, Seth and Ryan are lounging in the pool when Summer tells Seth what Trey did to Marissa. Ryan finds out and decides to go old-school Ryan Atwood: Trey needs a good punching. At the McMansion, Jimmy and Julie tell Marissa that the Coopers are going to be a family again, but this moment is broken up when Seth calls to tell Marissa that Ryan knows. They rush to Trey's apartment to attempt to break up the fighting, and they find Ryan in a life-threatening situation. Marissa acts of out defense for Ryan, picking up the gun that Jess gave to Trey earlier and shooting him in the back.</p>

<h2>Pop-Culture References</h2>

<p><b>The way things have been going, I'll bet that's Oliver.</b>
<br />There was a widely circulated online rumor that Oliver Trask, Marissa's therapy friend who tried to kill her, would reapper at Kirsten's therapy. The writers use this line to point out that this particular &quot;spoiler&quot; was a red herring.</p>

<p><b>You wouldn't believe the North Shore</b>
<br />Amanda Righetti was a star of Fox's short-lived drama &quot;North Shore&quot; which was set in Hawaii.</p>

<p>The funeral is held in a chapel that looks remarkably like the one used during Caleb and Julie's wedding during the first season finale. This may be a reference to that previous episode.</p>

<h2>Episode Quotes</h2>

<p><b>Kirsten:</b> Don't you say a word. I let you into this house.
<br /><b>Ryan:</b> Yeah, you did, because my own mom couldn't take care of me. Because she wouldn't get help, even though I asked her to. I don't want to see that happen again to someone I love.</p>

<p><b>Sandy :</b> Rest in peace, Caleb. And if you can't do that, I'm sure heaven could use a few more McMansions.</p>

<p><b>Seth</b> <i>(while at the bait shop)</i>: Do I still even work here? I should find out for tax purposes.</p>

<p><b>Trey:</b> Dude, I know, but Jess turned out to be a little crazier than I expected.
<br /><b>Ryan:</b> Really? That a surprise considering you met her face down in a pool.</p>

<p><b>Seth:</b> Yeah, apparently mom's a drunk and today's the intervention. So plan your afternoon accordingly.</p>

<p><b>Jimmy:</b> What if I decided to stay? What if we gave it another shot? We're both older and wiser now.
<br /><b>Julie:</b> We'll, I'm certainly wiser.</p>

<p><b>Trey:</b> Why don't you ever worry about things like calculus and Mayan history like a normal teenager?
<br /><b>Jess:</b> Bad parenting.</p>
