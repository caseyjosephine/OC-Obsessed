<h1>&gt; &gt; frequently asked questions</h1>

<p>If you're new to the show and have some questions, here is the place to come! As an obsessed fan and a Southern California native, I'm more than qualified to answer your most pressing questions. New questions are added often, so keep checking back here.</p>

<h2>General Show Questions</h2>

<p><b>I've heard good things about The O.C., when can I watch it?</b>- In the U.S. and Canada, the O.C. airs Thrusdays at 9 on Fox and CTV, respectively. If you live in another country, you will need to check your local tv listings.</p>

<p><b>What's with the plastic horses? I don't get it...</b>- When Summer goes into Seth's room, she finds a plastic toy horse that he has named Captain Oats. She makes fun of him, but Seth later finds out that she has her own little pony, Princess Sparkle. The two horses have come to be a symbol of Seth and Summer's relationship.</p>

<p><b>Who sings the theme song?</b>- The song on the opening credits is &quot;California&quot; by the band <a href="http://www.phantomplanet.com/">Phantom Planet.</a> You can find the song on the album <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00005YVQA/qid=1122842720/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-6563183-8882351?v=glance&s=music&n=507846">The Guest</a>.</p>

<h2>Location Questions</h2>

<p><b>Is the O.C. really filmed in Newport?</b>- Nope, the show is filmed on a soundstage in Manhattan Beach, California, and many of the beach scenes were actually filmed on Redondo Peir.</p>

<p><b>Can I go see a filming of the show?</b>- Fox's set is closed, probably to keep screaming girls from trying to kidnap Ben and Adam, so you won't be able to catch a taping on set. However, the cast does a bit of filming on location as well, so you may be lucky enough to spot them as they film on the beach (much like Summer stumbled upon the cast of 'The Valley.')</p>

<p><b>Where are the main filming locations, because I could have sworn that I saw The Bait Shop the other day...</b>- The Bait Shop is an empty building in Redondo Beach. Much of the outdoor filming is shot on the Redondo Beach Peir, at Newport Beach, and at the Balboa Beach Pier. The scenes at Harbor High School are shot at <a href="http://www.msmc.la.edu/pages/1.asp">Mount Saint Mary's College</a>. Visit <a href="http://www.andiwaited.net/katie/trip/OC.htm">as seen on The O.C.</a> for more information.</p>

<p><b>I'm going on vacation to Orange County! What should I visit?</b>- Definitly visit Redondo Beach. After you're done tanning, you may want to go shopping at <a href="http://www.southcoastplaza.com/">South Coast Plaza</a> (where Marissa shoplifts during Christmas) and grab a bite at <a href="http://www.in-n-out.com/">In-n-Out Burger</a>, which has been featured on the show several times.</p>

<p><b>Are Rachel and Adam really engaged?</b>- Tabloids have been reporting that the very private couple are engaged, but there has been no official word from either of them. So far, all we know for sure is that the two are dating.</p>

<p><b>What about Ben and Mischa?</b>- Nope. Mischa is currently involved with her on-again, off-again oil heir boyfriend, Brandon Davis. <a href="http://www.mischa-b.com">Mischa-B</a> usually has the most recent news on Mischa and Brandon's tumoltuous relationship.</p>

<p><b>These kids look a bit old to be in high school. How old are the actors?</b>- Mischa Barton is the actress closest to her character's age- she's 19. Ben will be 27 in September, Adam is 25, and Rachel will be turning 24 in August. </p>

<h2>Merchandise Questions</h2>

<p><b>When is the next DVD coming out?</b>- The O.C. Season Two will be released on DVD on August 23rd, 2005, a couple weeks before the second season premieres. You can <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0009K7QZ8/qid=1122841897/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-6563183-8882351?v=glance&s=dvd&n=507846">preorder it from Amazon</a> for $49.99, and they will have it in your mailbox on the release date.</p>

<p><b>When is The O.C. Mix 5 going to be relased?</b> So far, there has been no news of a Mix 5, although considering the amount of money that has been made on the previous cds, I'm sure there will be one. Keep checking OC-Obsessed and <a href="http://www.musicfromtheoc.com">Music From The O.C.</a> for cd news.</p>

<p><b>I want to buy the outfit Marissa was wearing on the last episode. Where should I go??</b>- <a href="http://www.ebay.com">Ebay</a> is always a good place to try.</p> 

<h2>Miscellaneous Questions</h2>

<p><b>What font is used on The O.C.'s logo?</b>- I've messed around with it for awhile, and I'm now pretty sure that it's a commercial font. However, you can get a similar effect in Photoshop by using 150 point bold Century Gothic (which comes on your computer) and -100 tracking (the space between the numbers).</p>

<p><b>What happened to Buzz Rodell's offical O.C. Blog?</b>- The blog was taken down due to some copyright issues, and people who are friends with Buzz have said not to expect him to be back. However, you can find an <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040925022117/http://ocfan.blogspot.com/">archived verision</a>, minus the awesome pictures.</p>

<p><b>Do people really called Orange County &quot;The O.C.&quot;</b>- No, most people who live in Southern California call it Orange County. I've only heard tourists refer to it as The O.C.</p>
