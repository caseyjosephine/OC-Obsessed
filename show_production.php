<h1>&gt; &gt; production and post-production</h1>

<p>Thanks to <a href="http://millimeter.com/">Millimeter.com</a> for this great <a href="http://millimeter.com/digitalfilm/video_production_meets_post/">article!</a></p>

<p>The ambience of the new Fox drama The O.C. is intimately tied to the show's locations. Therefore, when shooting the pilot (on Kodak 5274 35mm stock for daytime sequences and 5279 Vision stock for night scenes) around Southern California, producers spared little expense and effort to capture the look and feel of Orange County's lush, colorful, upscale world. Filming 27 green-lit episodes for a single season that way, however, was hardly practical.</p>

<p>&quot;It wasn't very affordable or practical to shoot the entire series on location in 35mm,&quot; says Ben Kunde, the show's associate producer. &quot;In these cases, it's always about money as studios are trying to cut costs to make shows profitable. So we had to come up with another method for shooting the series, which would match the look and feel of the pilot.&quot;</p>

<h2>Blending Production and Post</h2>

<p>That method carefully blends production and postproduction, with digital dailies and digital mastering playing prominent roles. Producers decided to shoot the series on 16mm (Kodak 7274) stock, primarily on a huge set built at the Raleigh Studios soundstage in Manhattan Beach, Calif., mixing in pickup shots and stock shots of Newport Beach and other Southern California beach locales. From there, they rely on a digital mastering formula devised by Modern VideoFilm, Burbank, to make exteriors shot on the soundstage, vegetation, water, and a gigantic painted backdrop of the Pacific Ocean look like the same Orange County captured on film.</p>

<p>Kunde says the cost of building the set and commissioning the glimmering ocean vista backdrop (painted at Warner Brothers under supervision from production designer Thomas Fichter and DP Jamie Barber) was substantial, but not as costly as trying to routinely shoot on location around Orange County.</p>

<p>&quot;I've never worked on a show that relies this much on a singular location that is designed to specifically replicate a real location,&quot;
says Kunde. &quot;The reason we get away with it, besides obviously having very talented people, is the plan we came up with: building this tremendous set, conducting a [Grass Valley Spirit DataCine] transfer at Modern VideoFilm — the Spirit has really helped us overcome the fact that we are using 16mm — and a few CG enhancements here and there.</p>

<p>Since the pilot, all scenes at the mansion, interior or exterior, have been shot on a Manhattan Beach soundstage and then altered in post.</p>

<p>&quot;But mainly, through the use of color and color theory, we are selling the mood of our show that we created for the pilot, which is this notion that life in Orange County is good, the weather is good, and so forth. It wasn't cheap to do it this way, but going out on location all the time would be very expensive, especially when exposed to the elements, changing light, and all that stuff. Few things are as expensive as frequently taking a large crew on location.&quot;</p>

<h2>Colorist Contributions</h2>

<p>Barber says he concentrates on &quot;selling the whole thing with color and light&quot; through close collaborations with Modern dailies colorist Jeff Benham and senior colorist Rick Dalby.</p>

<p>&quot;When we first built the set, we had Rick come down and walk it with me,&quot; says Barber. &quot;We discussed the colors, the lighting plan, all that stuff, and he contributed to the overall plan to saturate colors, warm the light, and add some grain. Since then, we have created a process that allows him to make sure our color plan remains consistent all the way through.&quot;</p>

<p>First, though, Benham transfers the 16mm film on Modern's Spirit and then provides an initial color pass to Barber and producers on DVD — a system that Barber feels &quot;is worth every penny because the ability to have random access in viewing and selecting the images speeds up the entire process.&quot; The producer, DP, and colorist all point out that the Spirit transfer plays a crucial role in their effort to match the 35mm look of the pilot. &quot;It gives you a much cleaner, noise-free, sharply focused look,&quot; Dalby says. &quot;For reasons of optics, transfer, less noise, the way it handles grain, the Spirit delivers a much better transfer when we are dealing with 16mm.&quot;</p>

<p>The DVD dailies, which serve as the foundation of the offline edit for each episode, also directly aid Dalby's mission of maintaining the look and consistency of the show. &quot;[Benham's] work cuts down on the time it takes me to color-correct an episode because it's so consistent,&quot; he says.</p>

<p>After the episode is offlined, Dalby gets to work using a standard-def, da Vinci 8:8:8 DUI color correction system. He also performs a noise-reduction pass using a Bosch MNR-11 system in order to more closely achieve the look and texture of 35mm film.</p>

<p>&quot;There are an awful lot of specific adjustments in settings that we use when working with 16mm — a lot of frequency things, noise reduction, sharpening, enhancement, and trying to set aperture coring and size to replicate the film grain of 35mm,&quot; says Dalby. &quot;I take a lot of extra time to do this on the Bosch machine, actually.&quot;</p>

<p>The colorist also routinely has to tweak the color and texture of the synthetic grass and other vegetation used on set. &quot;Perhaps the most difficult part of shooting this thing on a stage is the fake grass,&quot; says Barber. He also adds glimmers to painted water in the Pacific Ocean backdrop and in the house's backyard pool and Jacuzzi.</p>

<p>&quot;The swimming pool and water are real. The ocean, sky, grass, and plants are all fake,&quot; says Dalby. &quot;That's where I use secondary color correction to change the luminance hue and saturation values to approximate the look of the real samples we had from the pilot's real locations. We mute the greens from the grass and other plants, adjusting the hues slightly, depending on whether we are shooting outside the house or inside, looking out. With secondary color correction, we can isolate the blues and greens without affecting the rest of the shot, and we can tone them up and down to look more realistic.&quot;</p>
