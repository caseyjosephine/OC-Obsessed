<h1>&gt; &gt; about oc obsessed</h1>

<p>After seeing the first few episodes of The O.C. when it premiered in 2003, I know that I was completely obsessed. The show was one of the best I had ever seen, so I decided to create a fansite for it. During 2003, I made a site entitled The Newport Project. The site remained open through the year, but after the finale I was faced with the issue of graduating high school and going to college. The site fell into disrepair, which made me pretty sad. After realizing that I missed being a webmaster, I decided to bring back the newport project, under the new name of OC-Obsessed!</p>

<p>OC Obsessed opened in May of 2005 and strives to be your number one source of information about The O.C. We aim for the most complete information on the show and the characters, as well as pictures and video clips. We also give opporunities for fans to share theories, fanfiction, fan-art, and anything else O.C. related. Contributions are always wecome, if you have anything to donate to the site, make sure to <a href="mailto:virtualcouture@gmail.com">email me</a> and I will put it on the site.</p>
