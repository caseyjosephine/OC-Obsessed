<p><strong>Character Name</strong>- Summer Roberts<br /><br />
<strong>Think of Her As</strong>- The fashionable, confident, popular, mostly normal one<br /><br />
<strong>Season One Recap</strong>- Summer was first introduced as Marissa's best friend who said profound things such as &quot;Chino...ew...&quot; All that changed when she started to realize that *gasp* she liked Seth Cohen. After a tormenting love triange between her, Seth and Anna, she finally got the guy only to realize that the physical act of love isn't always so hot. Her summer began on a bad note, when Seth decided to sail away into the sunset. <br /><br />
<strong>You can probably find her</strong>- Hanging out with Marissa or bickering at Seth, an act that she seems to find very satisfying.<br /><br /> 
<strong>Great Summer Quote</strong>- &quot;Oh, I will compromise your vision. Do not forget my rage-blackouts!&quot;
