<p>Classes and homework kept Lily busy all week. She barely had anytime to think about the upcoming dance or even flirt with Sirius. It seemed like the all teachers had decided to give them extra work, even though it probably just seemed like it since everyone was anticipating the upcoming dance. Lily awoke early on the morning of the visit to Hogsmede. She got ready and started to rush towards the great hall when she ran into someone.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, sorry,&quot; she said, looking up at who she had run into. It was Sirius, and she noted how great he looked, and how she couldn't wait to slow dance with him at the dance.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, don't get too fast there Lil. You scared me.&quot; he said.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, right. Me scare one of the biggest pranksters in all of Hogwarts. You <em>sure</em> look <em>really</em> scared.&quot; said Lily.</p>


<p>&quot;Oh really, I do? Well, that just goes to show you how much you scared me. You should be ashamed of yourself.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, actually I am quite sorry. But only because I don't want to hurt my date before the dance. I couldn'tshow up to the dance if you had two broken legs.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, so you could break both my legs by just running into me? I'm afraid of what you could do to me when we are dancing. Maybe you're just too dangerous!&quot; Lily laughed.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I guess that's a risk you will just have to take!&quot; she said.</p>

<p>&quot;It'll be my pleasure. Just let me walk you down to the great hall. I have to make sure you don't try to hurt anymore innocent bystanders.&quot; said Sirius with a laugh as they began their trek to the great hall.</p>

<p>As they entered the great hall they saw James with his date, Nancy. Nancy was one of his good friends, and also a good friend of Lily and Jamie. She had dark brown hair that went down a little past her shoulders and deep, brown eyes. She was one of the chasers on the Gryffindor quidditch team. Lily and Sirius quickly joined them.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey Nancy, how are you on this lovely day?&quot; said Lily as she sat down next to her.</p>

<p>&quot;My, aren't we in a good mood,&quot; said Nancy. &quot;I wonder what has brought this upon you. Although I think that I could take a pretty good guess...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, but I don't think now is the time for guessing,&quot; said Lily quickly. &quot;I'm going to go get breakfast!&quot;</p>

<p align="center">***</p>

<p>It was a beautiful day outside at Hogsmede. The sky was blue and contained very few clouds. The temperature was just right: not too hot, but not cold either. Lily, Sirius, James and Nancy walked along the path looking for the Simply Magical Robe Shop. Nancy was the first one to spot it. It was an elegant looking building on the left side of the street, right next to Zonko's joke shop. The boys looked at each other, and James winked with a twinkle in his eye.</p>

<p>&quot;We're off to get our robes. Will you please come in and get yours?&quot; said Lily.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, sure. It's not like we will be able to get them any other time.&quot; said James.</p>

<p>&quot;Besides, it's not like it could be too hard, right?&quot; said Sirius.</p>

<p>It didn't take long for Sirius and James to find their robes. James picked out soft gray robes and Sirius found some that were navy blue. They then disappered off to Zonko's.</p>

<p>The girls were a different matter. It seemed to Lily that she had tried on every single robe that the store had. Red, yellow and orange robes were obviously out, however there were so many other types of robes that Lily could not decide which one's she wanted. She finally found an emrald green robe that was just the same color as her eyes, and Nancy found a baby blue one. Lily wondered where Jamie was, she was supposed to meet her in this store an hour ago. The girls were at the cash register buying their clothes when James and Sirius came back in.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I guess you guys are finally done. Why don't we go looking around in the stores for awhile.&quot; said James.</p>

<p>&quot;What do you mean done? We still need jewelry, and haircuts, and manicures and pedicures. We'll meet you outside The Three Broomsticks in an hour and a half.&quot; said Nancy. Lily laughed.</p>

<p>&quot;Girls,&quot; said Sirius, and they walked away quickly.</p>

<p align="center"> *** </p>

<p>It was getting to almost the time that Lily and Nancy were supposed to go meet the boys outside the three broomsticks. They had loads of purchases, all of which were for the dance. They were walking to the three broomsticks when a man stopped them in a dark corner of Hogsmede. He was tall, and his hair was matted. Lily and Nancy were instantly afraid of him. He spoke, and his voice was the scarest thing that they had ever heard, too horrible for them to even describe. </p>

<p>&quot;Hello girls. Do you know what today is?&quot; he said in a whisper.</p>

<p>&quot;Get away from us!&quot; Lily yelled.</p>

<p>&quot;It is the first day that Mars will align with Jupiter. A day that a new evil will come into the world and cause a new downfall.&quot; he said.</p>

<p>&quot;Is that a threat? Our boyfriends will come and beat you up!&quot; said Nancy.</p>

<p>&quot;You know as well as I do that you are both single,&quot; he said. &quot;I would beware not to cross me, for I am the dark lord Voldemort.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You aren't a lord. I will never beware of you. You don't scare me!&quot; Lily lied. She was actually very afraid now.</p>

<p>&quot;We'll see about that after I finish with you.&quot; said Voldemort. He took out his wand and touched it to her skin. It instantly started to burn, but Lily could not move.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, get away from her!&quot; Sirius yelled. He pulled her away from Voldemort and put his arm protectivly around her. &quot;I don't know who you are, but you can't mess with her without messing with me!&quot; Voldemort instanly disapperated.</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you,&quot; said Lily. She slipped her arm around Sirius' waist and they walked together to the three broomsticks.</p>
